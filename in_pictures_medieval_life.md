This image, dated c1150, depicts officers receiving and weighing coins from taxpayers at the exchequer in Westminster, London. As today, medieval people were concerned about money and status. In the cities, people had all kinds of jobs: merchants, salesmen, carpenters, butchers, weavers, foodsellers, architects, painters, jugglers. And in the countryside it was not at all the case that everyone was an impoverished ‘serf’ (that is, ‘unfree’ and tied to the land). Many peasants were free men – and women – and owned their own land.

This image from Tacuinum Sanitatis, a medieval health handbook, dated before 1400, depicts a peasant with her daughter gathering ears of maize. Famine was a real danger for medieval men and women: faced with dwindling food supplies due to bad weather and poor harvests, people starved or barely survived on meagre rations like bark, berries and inferior corn and wheat damaged by mildew.

In this image dated c1400, a servant is seen tasting wine before serving it at the table. He is watched by priests, bishops and a king.

This is a c1275 Franco-Flemish depiction of a couple taking baths in adjoining tubs. Contrary to popular belief, even in the medieval period hygiene was considered a sign that you were civilised. Most major towns boasted public baths, as did many private houses. Bathtubs were made using similar techniques to those used to craft wine barrels.

This 13th-century image of a couple being married by a clergyman features in the Chapter Archive of Tarazona, Spain. In medieval London, there was often some confusion as to whether or not a couple was legally wed: a simple exchange of vows between a couple – made in the tavern, the street or even in bed – followed by ‘consummation’ was considered a valid marriage by the church. No witnesses were required, so it could be difficult for either party to prove or disprove that they were married.

This 14th-century illustration from Tacuinum Sanitatis, an illuminated medieval handbook of health, depicts women cutting pigs' trotters. Cooking, washing and cleaning had to be done from scratch in the Middle Ages. Before dinner could be cooked, the fire had to be lit, and the medieval housewife also had to churn butter, brew ale and tend livestock, as well as spin and weave cloth to make clothes for the family.

This c1450 image depicts mixed bathing and merrymaking at a medieval bathhouse. As musicians didn’t usually play at bathhouses, it is possible the scene represents a fete or public holiday. Medieval people enjoyed midsummer festivals, and they often raised money for charity by holding a ‘help ale’: brewing up a batch of ale, having a big party to drink it, and collecting donations.
